# Simple-Cricket-Game---HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript

This repository contains a Simple Cricket Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to play against the computer in a fun, quick, and interactive cricket match. The user selects an option (runs), and the computer randomly chooses a number as well. Based on both choices, the outcome of the game is determined:

* If the user's choice matches the computer's choice, the user is declared out.
* Otherwise, the user's score keeps adding up with each turn.
* The goal is to score as many runs as possible before getting out.

# Features

* Interactive Gameplay: Users can select runs (from 1 to 6), while the computer generates a random selection.
* Result Calculation: The game declares whether the user is out or continues to play based on both choices.
* Score Tracking: The score increases after each valid input and ends when the user is out.
* Responsive Design: The game UI is styled using CSS for a seamless experience across devices.
